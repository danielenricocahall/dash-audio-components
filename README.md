# Development and Contributing
- Create a Poetry environment and install all required dependencies: `poetry install --dev`
- Install [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- Install `npm` (`brew install npm`)
- `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Build the js files: `npm run build:js`
- Build the Dash components (Python modules): `npm run build:py`

Changes in the React components  (`src/lib/components`), such as exposing new properties or updating audio collection logic require running steps 5 and 6 above. Otherwise, the existing js files should be fine, and the autogenerated Python modules should not be edited.
